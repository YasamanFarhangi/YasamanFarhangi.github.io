# Well, in this post I'm going to explain some questions of final exam that I couldn't solve during the exam. But, I succeeded to solve a few of them within these days. So I would like to tell you why I didn't solve these questions during the final and how I solved them.

- The first question that I solved was q6_change_student. Actually I didn't have any problem in understanding the question. I only had problem in remembering the syntax! After I searched for the correct syntax, problem solved.
 

- In python, there were a lot of questions that I had problem in making the proper circumstances. Each question needed several particular conditions that after 3 hours it was really hard for me to think about the conditions and even after the exam I wasn't able to solve all the questions. The first question I solved in python was related to function_pointer. I've never seen a sample of this question in python, so I was really surprised. It was not hard actually but I needed some help in imaging how it was possible in python so I asked one of my friend about the correct algorithm and problem solved. Another thing I didn't know was getting a function as an input of another function. It was not complicated at all but a sample code was required.


- Not being familiar with class in python was a barrier for me. I really didn't spend enough time on practicing  class. Although I was familiar with struct in C which is somehow the same as class, but I couldn't answer q6_change_student in python as well. After I studied class at home, I could simply asnwer questions: q6_change_student, q7_student_tostring and q8_create_student. You know, this always happens in exams. There's only one thing that you don't know, but 2 or 3 questions are related to that thing! I was really disappointed at the exam cause I lost 3 questions for not knowing one thing.

- After all, I think the exam not only included many questions, but also was harder than what I thought it would be. Plus, I think answering questions like that needed an energitic and focused mind. But since the exam approximately took 5 hours(although it needed more than this), our brain became so tired and personally, I couldn't concentrate on the exam anymore. Anyway, I'm happy that I could solve some of the questions after the exam because I was really nervous, and I was thinking that I haven't learn  anything during this term. Now I know I was wrong. I may not answer all the questions but right know I'm believing in myself a little bit more than before.

# Thank you:)
